# TP2_synthese_MOREL_PAO

The objectives of this lab is to develop a TFTP client using RFC specifications and Wireshark captures.

Indications : n in the "gettftpn.c" files means that it's the n-th question.
(example : gettftp2.c is the code for the 2nd question)

First, in order to obtain the server's address, we re-used the code previously used in the TDm3, with the getaddrinfo() function.
